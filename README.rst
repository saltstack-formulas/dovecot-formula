dovecot-formula
===============

A salt formula that installs and configures the dovecot IMAP server. It currently supports an Arch, Debian/Ubuntu, Gentoo or
Red Hat styled layout of the dovecot configuration files in /etc. 
Config file content (where needed) is stored in pillar (see pillar.example).

Config file to pillar mappings:
===============================

.. code::

  /etc/dovecot/local.conf in dovecot:config:local

e.g.:

.. code::

  /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext in dovecot:config:dovecotext:sql
  /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext in dovecot:config:dovecotext:ldap
  /etc/dovecot/conf.d/auth-ldap.conf.ext in dovecot:config:confext:ldap
  /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ldap.conf in dovecot:config:conf:10-ldap
  /etc/dovecot/auth.d/example.tld.passwd in dovecot:config:passwd_files:example.tld


.. note::

Any help, suggestions if this works / how this works for other distributions are welcome.

Available states
================

.. contents::
    :local:

``dovecot``
------------

Installs and configures the dovecot package, and ensures that the associated dovecot service is running.

Minion configuration
====================

Unfortunately, automating the provisioning of some delicate settings is not possible,
or anyway not ideal in my opinion.
E.g., the `login_trusted_networks` setting for Dovecot is difficult to safely fetch from the minion;
therefore, the best solution I could think of for now is adding a section to the pillar, like this:

. code::

postfix:
  mynetworks:
    - 172.16.1.0/24
    - 192.168.0.0/24

The list of networks will then be expanded, joined, and injected into Dovecot's conf files appropriately.

Also, there are other grains related to the DB if you decide to use it:

. code::

postfix:
  dbhost: hostname.example.com
  dbname: postfixadmin
  dbuser: postfixadmin
  dbpassword: verysecret
